# 🧠 Gemini AI Fallback & Thought Process Visualization

## 🎯 Overview

The Trinetra AI Orchestration system now features **Gemini AI fallback** and a beautiful **Thought Process Visualization** - perfect for hackathon demos to show judges exactly how your AI system thinks!

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Gemini AI Fallback**
When an AI agent from Fitch Marketplace fails or is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to Google Gemini to complete the task.

### 2. **Thought Process Visualization**
A real-time, detailed view of every decision, reasoning step, agent call, and fallback that happens during command execution.

---

## 🔧 Setup

### 1. Add Gemini API Key

Your Gemini API key has been configured:
```
AIzaSyA5twRyFZ1jDNwzqIsukV9PmI3qZFiBzug
```

Create `/backend/.env` file:
```bash
cd /Users/joker2307/Desktop/unagi/backend
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file should contain:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyA5twRyFZ1jDNwzqIsukV9PmI3qZFiBzug
```

### 2. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
python3 main.py
```

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### Option 1: From AI Orchestrator

1. Click `[AI-ORCHESTRATOR] 🤖` in terminal
2. Enter a command: "Book an Uber if the tennis court is dry"
3. Click `[EXECUTE COMMAND]`
4. Click `🧠 [FETCH AI THOUGHTS]` button
5. See the complete thought process!

### Option 2: During Execution

The thought process is captured in real-time and can be viewed at any point after execution completes.

## 💭 Thought Process Types

The system tracks 5 types of thoughts:

| Icon | Type | Color | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 🤔 | Reasoning | Blue | General reasoning and analysis |
| ⚡ | Decision | Yellow | Important decisions made |
| 🤖 | Agent Call | Green | Calls to Fitch Marketplace agents |
| 🧠 | Fallback | Purple | Gemini AI fallback activated |
| ✨ | Result | Cyan | Final results and outputs |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Gemini Fallback

Force an agent failure to see fallback:
```bash
# In backend/fitch_marketplace.py, temporarily make an agent fail
# Then run command and watch Gemini take over!
```

### Test Thought Process

```bash
# Execute any command
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agent/process_command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Check the weather and my wallet"}'

# Get context with thought process
curl http://localhost:5000/api/agent/context_status/<context_id>

# thought_process array will be populated!
```
