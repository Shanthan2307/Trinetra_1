## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"Trinetra is an AI-powered security camera network that uses blockchain verification and multi-agent orchestration. You give it a command like 'Book an Uber if the tennis court is dry' - and it automatically breaks it down, finds specialized agents, executes tasks conditionally, and records everything on Sui blockchain. If any agent fails, Gemini AI takes over as fallback. You can see the complete thought process in real-time. It's CCTV + AI + Blockchain + Agent Orchestration - all in one."

## 🎯 Demo Commands

### Easy (15 seconds):
```
"Check the weather"
```

### Medium (30 seconds):
```
"Check my wallet balance and the weather"
```

### Complex (45 seconds):
```
"Book an Uber if the tennis court is dry"
```

### Show-stopper (60 seconds):
```
"Analyze all cameras, check my wallet, and book a ride if everything is safe"
```

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Error:
```bash
# Kill and restart
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9
cd backend && python3 main.py
```

### Frontend Error:
```bash
# Clear and restart
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### Gemini Not Working:
- Shows fallback to rule-based
- Still works, just less intelligent
