# 🎥 CCTV .m3u8 Stream Integration - FIXED

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The CCTV footage system was not properly handling .m3u8 (HLS) stream URLs. Users could not add cameras with .m3u8 streams.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **No URL Validation** - System accepted any URL without checking if it's a valid stream
2. **Missing CORS Headers** - Cross-origin requests were failing
3. **Incomplete Stream Detection** - Regex patterns weren't catching all .m3u8 URLs
4. **No Error Feedback** - Users didn't know why streams failed

---

## 🔧 Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Stream Validation (`main.py`)

#### Added `validate_m3u8_url()` Function
```python
def validate_m3u8_url(url):
    """Validate if an .m3u8 URL is accessible and returns a valid playlist"""
    - Fetches the .m3u8 playlist
    - Checks for valid HLS markers (#EXTM3U, #EXT-X-)
    - Returns validation status and detailed error messages
    - Handles timeouts and connection errors
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Downloads the .m3u8 playlist file
- ✅ Verifies it contains valid HLS tags
- ✅ Returns detailed error messages for debugging
- ✅ Handles network errors gracefully

#### Enhanced URL Analysis
```python
- Detects stream type (HLS, DASH, MP4, RTSP, etc.)
- Validates .m3u8 URLs before accepting them
- Improved regex patterns to find all stream URLs
- Searches entire HTML source, not just script tags
- Removes duplicate URLs automatically
```

#### Added CORS Support
```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)  # Enable cross-origin requests
```

### 2. Frontend Improvements (`App.js`)

#### Better Error Handling
```javascript
- Displays validation errors to users
- Shows stream type in success messages (HLS, MP4, etc.)
- Indicates when streams are validated (✓ Validated)
- Longer toast duration for error messages (5s)
- Detailed error messages from backend
```

#### Enhanced User Feedback
```javascript
Success: "Found 2 stream(s)! (HLS) ✓ Validated"
Error: "Invalid or inaccessible .m3u8 stream: Request timeout"
```

### 3. Video Player Support (`CCTVGrid.js`)

The existing HLS.js integration already supports .m3u8:
```javascript
- Uses HLS.js for modern browsers
- Falls back to native HLS for Safari
- Automatic error recovery
- Network error handling
- Media error recovery
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/joker2307/Desktop/unagi/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `flask-cors` - For cross-origin requests
- `beautifulsoup4` - For HTML parsing
- `lxml` - For faster parsing
- All other required packages

### Step 2: Restart Backend
```bash
cd /Users/joker2307/Desktop/unagi/backend
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Add .m3u8 Camera Stream

1. Click `[INIT-CAMERA-PROTOCOL]`
2. Enter .m3u8 URL directly or webpage URL:
   - **Direct**: `https://example.com/stream.m3u8`
   - **Webpage**: `https://camguide.net/camera-page`
3. Click `[ANALYZE URL]`
4. System will:
   - ✓ Detect it's an HLS stream
   - ✓ Validate the .m3u8 playlist
   - ✓ Show "Found 1 stream(s)! (HLS) ✓ Validated"
5. Enter coordinates: `37.7749,-122.4194`
6. Enter description: "Main Entrance Camera"
7. Click `[COMMIT]`

### Step 4: View in CCTV Grid

Click `[OPEN-CCTV]` to see your cameras streaming live!

## 📋 Validation Process

### For Direct .m3u8 URLs:
```
User enters URL → Backend validates → Checks playlist
                                         ↓
                                   Valid? Yes → Accept
                                         ↓
                                   Valid? No → Reject with reason
```

### For Webpage URLs:
```
User enters webpage → Fetch HTML → Search for streams
                                         ↓
                                   Find .m3u8 URLs
                                         ↓
                                   Validate each
                                         ↓
                                   Return only valid ones
```

## 🧪 Testing Examples

### Test with Working .m3u8 Stream:
```
https://stream-uc2-charlie.dropcam.com/nexus_aac/54d1f7859e9741448b240eb44e972098/chunklist_w2002435562.m3u8?public=aQAoqnQ5Af
```

Expected Result:
```
✓ Direct stream URL detected! Type: HLS
✓ Valid .m3u8 playlist found
Success: Found 1 stream(s)! (HLS) ✓ Validated
```

### Test with Webpage:
```
https://camguide.net/usa/california/san-francisco/tennis/
```

Expected Result:
```
✓ Webpage fetched! Searching for video sources...
✓ Found N stream URL(s)
✓ Validated: https://...stream.m3u8
Success: Found 1 stream(s)! (HLS) ✓ Validated
```

### Test with Invalid URL:
```
https://invalid-stream.com/fake.m3u8
```

Expected Result:
```
✗ Error accessing URL: Connection error
Error: Invalid or inaccessible .m3u8 stream: Connection error
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Backend Logs
Check terminal running `main.py` for detailed logs:
```
Analyzing CCTV URL: https://...
Validating m3u8 URL: https://...
✓ Valid .m3u8 playlist found
✓ Found 1 stream URL(s)
```

### Frontend Console
Press F12 in browser, check Console tab:
```javascript
Stream info: HLS stream validated successfully
Adding new camera: 123456 37.7749,-122.4194 https://...
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Invalid or inaccessible .m3u8 stream"
**Solution**: 
- Check if URL is publicly accessible
- Verify it's a complete .m3u8 URL
- Test URL directly in VLC or browser

**Issue**: "CORS error"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `flask-cors` is installed
- Restart backend server
- Check browser console for CORS messages

**Issue**: "Request timeout"
**Solution**:
- Stream server may be slow or down
- Try again in a few seconds
- Increase timeout in `validate_m3u8_url()` if needed

```

### Frontend Stream Detection
```javascript
- Improved regex: /https?://[^\s<>"']+?\.m3u8[^\s<>"']*/
- Catches URLs with query parameters
- Handles URLs in quotes, brackets, etc.
- Validates before showing to user
