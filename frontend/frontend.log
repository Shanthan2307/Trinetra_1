WARNING in ./node_modules/asn1.js/lib/asn1/api.js 17:12-42
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'vm' in '/Users/joker2307/Desktop/unagi/frontend/node_modules/asn1.js/lib/asn1'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "vm": require.resolve("vm-browserify") }'
	- install 'vm-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "vm": false }

webpack compiled with 1 error and 2 warnings
The build failed because the process exited too early. This probably means the system ran out of memory or someone called `kill -9` on the process.
