## 💻 Technical Details

### Why So Many YouTube Restrictions?

**YouTube's Perspective:**
- Wants viewers on YouTube.com (more ads)
- Respects content creator choices
- Copyright protection
- Age verification requirements
- Regional licensing deals

**Video Owner Options:**
- ✅ Allow embedding (accessible)
- ❌ Disable embedding (restricted)
- 🔒 Age restrictions
- 🌍 Region restrictions

### The Viewer's Solution:

```javascript
// Detects YouTube errors automatically
video.onerror = function() {
    showYouTubeError(id);
};

// Monitors for playback errors
setInterval(() => {
    if (hasError) {
        showYouTubeError(id);
    }
}, 500);

// Shows helpful message with button
function showYouTubeError(id) {
    // Display: "⚠️ Can't Play Here"
    // Button: "📺 Watch on YouTube"
}
```
