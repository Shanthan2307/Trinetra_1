## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Web Viewer Enhancements:
```javascript
// Advanced HLS.js configuration
- maxBufferLength: 30s          // Pre-buffer 30 seconds
- maxMaxBufferLength: 60s        // Maximum buffer capacity
- liveSyncDurationCount: 3       // Stay near live edge
- Auto-reconnection with retry   // Up to 10 attempts
- Codec switching fallback       // Try different codecs
- Buffer monitoring              // Track buffering status
```

### FFmpeg Optimizations:
```bash
-fflags +genpts+igndts     # Generate timestamps
-flags low_delay           # Minimize latency
-probesize 5000000         # Better stream detection
-analyzeduration 5000000   # Thorough analysis
-sync audio                # Smooth audio sync
-framedrop                 # Drop frames if needed
```

### Python Viewer Features:

## 📊 How It Works

### HLS Streaming Process:
```
Browser/Player
    ↓
Fetches: playlist.m3u8 (master playlist)
    ↓
Fetches: chunklist_w*.m3u8 (segment list)
    ↓
Downloads: media_*.ts (video segments)
    ↓
Plays continuously while fetching new segments
```

### Buffer Strategy:
```
[Video Segments] → [Buffer (30-60s)] → [Display]
                        ↑
                   Auto-refills
                   Handles gaps
                   Error recovery
```
