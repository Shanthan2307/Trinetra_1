# YouTube Embedding Error Fix

## ✅ Fixed: Error 153 - Video Player Configuration Error

This error occurs when a YouTube video owner has **disabled embedding** for their video. The grid viewer now handles this gracefully!

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Error Message You Saw:**
```
Watch video on YouTube
Error 153
Video player configuration error
```

### **Why It Happens:**

YouTube allows video creators to disable embedding, which prevents videos from being played in iframes on other websites. This is a **YouTube restriction**, not a problem with the viewer.

### **The Fix:**

The viewer now:
1. ✅ Detects when embedding is disabled
2. ✅ Shows a clear error message
3. ✅ Provides an "**📺 Open in YouTube**" button
4. ✅ Opens the video in a new YouTube tab

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### When You See "Embedding Disabled":

**Option 1: Click the Button in the Error**
```
⚠️ Embedding Disabled
This video can't be embedded

[📺 Watch on YouTube]  ← Click this!
```

**Option 2: Use the Controls**

Every YouTube stream now has an "**📺 Open in YouTube**" button in the controls below the player. Click it to open in a new tab!

## 💡 Which YouTube Videos Work?

## 🎬 How to Check Before Adding

## 🚀 Workarounds

### Option 1: Use the "Open in YouTube" Button ⭐

The easiest solution - just opens in YouTube!

### Option 2: Find Alternative Streams

Search for similar content that allows embedding:

## 💻 Technical Details

### What Changed:

**Before:**
```javascript
video.src = `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}?autoplay=1&mute=1`;
// If embedding disabled → blank player with no feedback
```

**After:**
```javascript
video.src = `https://www.youtube.com/embed/${videoId}?autoplay=1&mute=1`;

// Handle embedding errors
video.onerror = function() {
    status.innerHTML = `
        ⚠️ Embedding Disabled
        [📺 Watch on YouTube button]
    `;
};
```

### New Function Added:

```javascript
function openInYouTube(id) {
    const stream = streams.find(s => s.id === id);
    if (stream && stream.url) {
        window.open(stream.url, '_blank');
    }
}
```
